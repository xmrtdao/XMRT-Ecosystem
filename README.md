# XMRT-Ecosystem - Fully Autonomous DAO

Welcome to the XMRT-Ecosystem repository! This repository houses the various decentralized applications (dApps) and core components that form the XMRTNET ecosystem, powered by **Autonomous ElizaOS** - a fully autonomous AI agent system.

## 🤖 Autonomous ElizaOS

The XMRT DAO is managed by **Autonomous ElizaOS**, a production-ready AI agent system that:

- **Fully Manages DAO Operations**: Governance, treasury, community, security, and analytics
- **GPT-5 Ready**: Seamless integration when GPT-5 becomes available
- **Production Deployed**: High-availability, fault-tolerant autonomous operations
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Operates across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism
- **Emergency Response**: Automatic threat detection and response
- **Human Oversight**: Optional human approval for high-risk decisions

### DenoClaw / SupaClaw

XMRT DAO's agent operations run entirely within the **Supabase Deno runtime** via the DenoClaw framework:

- **60-Second Execution**: Each edge function invocation handles a checkpointed sub-operation
- **Task Decomposition**: Complex workflows are broken into sequenced operations
- **State Persistence**: Checkpoints stored in Supabase Postgres between invocations
- **PDF Operations**: Agents can manipulate PDFs (merge, sign, watermark, compress) entirely in Deno
- **No External Servers**: All agent logic runs in Supabase Edge Functions

### MESHNET

Peer-to-peer mesh networking for **offline-capable Monero mining**:

- Devices form local mesh networks without internet via multicast UDP
- Mining jobs distributed across mesh peers
- Bridge nodes relay shares to pools when connectivity is available
- Validators verify share hashes before relay
- Designed for hostile/disconnected environments

## 📚 Organizational Structure

This repository is organized into a `main` branch that serves as the central hub for the entire XMRTNET DAO, linking to various independent dApps. Each major dApp or user experience (UX) within the ecosystem resides in its own dedicated branch, following a `ux/<dapp-name>` naming convention.

This structure allows for independent development, testing, and deployment of each dApp, while maintaining a cohesive overview on the `main` branch.

### **`main` Branch (XMRTNET DAO Hub)**

The `main` branch represents the overarching XMRTNET Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It will feature a high-level overview of the ecosystem and provide links and entry points to all the individual dApps.

### **`ux/<dapp-name>` Branches (Individual dApps)**

Each `ux/<dapp-name>` branch contains a complete, self-contained dApp or user experience. For example:

- `ux/cashdapp`: The XMRTNET CashDapp, a comprehensive financial application including dashboard, payments (terminal), banking, assets management, and user settings.
- `ux/trading-dapp`: The decentralized exchange (DEX) or trading interface for XMRT and other tokens.
- `ux/governance-dapp`: The dApp for XMRTNET DAO governance, allowing users to propose, vote on, and execute proposals.
- `ux/staking-dapp`: The dApp for staking XMRT tokens and earning rewards.
- `ux/nft-marketplace`: The dApp for browsing, buying, selling, and managing NFTs within the XMRT ecosystem.
- `ux/lending-dapp`: The dApp for decentralized lending and borrowing.

## 📂 Repository Contents
